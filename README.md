# Team Stat Tracker for Ultimate Frisbee
### A CPSC 210 Project by Eric Yee

## About Ultimate

[Ultimate frisbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)) 
is a 7-on-7 non-contact team sport where two teams try to catch the disc
(or frisbee) in the other team's endzone. Each catch in the endzone
is worth one point, and games end once one team scores 15 points or
the time limit is reached. 
Players move the disc up the field by passing it to one another
with the caveat of *not being able to walk or run while holding
the disc*. On-field players usually
rotate with off-field players after each point.

I discovered this game around the age of ten, and it has 
remained my favourite sport ever since. I hope to coach a high school team
soon, and that's where I got the inspiration for this project.

## What is this Project?

As the name suggests, this project aims to be a stat-tracking
application for those who manage ultimate frisbee teams. Players usually have
jersey numbers and designated positions as either cutters or handlers 
(although sometimes both). During games, team managers or coaches 
often keep track of who plays, scores, and assists on each point. 

This application will allow users to create teams along with
their players' information. Ideally, users will then be able to create games tied to 
a team and record game results and
player data for each point, with total player statistics
available on each player's profile. However, if implementing the functionality for each point
in games proves to be too challenging, player statistics may instead 
only be kept in their respective profile.
