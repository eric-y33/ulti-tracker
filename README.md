# Team Stat Tracker for Ultimate Frisbee
### A CPSC 210 Project by Eric Yee

## About Ultimate

[Ultimate frisbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)) 
is a 7-on-7 non-contact team sport where two teams try to catch the disc
(or frisbee) in the other team's endzone. Each catch in the endzone
is worth one point, and games end once one team scores 15 points or
the time limit is reached. 
Players move the disc up the field by passing it to one another
with the caveat of *not being able to walk or run while holding
the disc*. On-field players usually
rotate with off-field players after each point.

I discovered this game around the age of ten, and it has 
remained my favourite sport ever since. I hope to coach a high school team
soon, and that's where I got the inspiration for this project.

## What is this Project?

As the name suggests, this project aims to be a stat-tracking
application for those who manage ultimate frisbee teams. Players usually have
jersey numbers and designated positions as either cutters or handlers 
(although sometimes both). During games, team managers or coaches 
often keep track of who plays, assists, and scores on each point.

This application will allow users to add multiple player profiles to a team and record their
information. Users will then be able to see the names of all players on the team,
update any player's profile or game statistics, and remove existing players from the team if needed.

## Main User Stories (Implemented)

- As a user, when I select quit from the main menu, I want to be
  reminded to save my team's information and have the option to do so or not.
