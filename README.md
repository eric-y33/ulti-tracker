# Team Stat Tracker for Ultimate Frisbee
### A CPSC 210 Project by Eric Yee

## About Ultimate

[Ultimate frisbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)) 
is a 7-on-7 non-contact team sport where two teams try to score 15 points 
first by catching the disc
(or frisbee) in the other team's endzone. Each catch in the endzone
is worth one point. Players move the disc up the field by passing it to one another
with the caveat of *not being able to walk or run while holding
the disc*. On-field players usually
rotate with off-field players after each point.

I found out about this game around the age of ten, and it has 
remained my favourite sport ever since. I hope to coach a high school team
soon, and that's where I got the inspiration for this project.

## What is this Project?

As the name suggests, this project aims to be a stat-tracking
application for those who manage ultimate frisbee teams. Players usually have
designated positions as either cutters or handlers (although sometimes both),
as well as informal positions and jersey numbers that may be useful to keep
track of. During games, team managers or coaches often record who plays, 
scores, and assists on each point. 

This application will allow users to add and edit team members along with their
static information. They will then be able to create games and record
player data for each point, with game results available too.
